Overview:
    Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to when a customer ceases their relationship
 with a company or service provider. In today's highly competitive business environment,
 retaining customers is a critical factor for long-term success. Predicting customer churn can
 help organizations take proactive steps to retain customers, thus minimizing revenue loss.
 This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will
 churn based on their demographic, account, and service-related data.

  Problem Statement:
    The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer
 will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along
 with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and
 online security), we will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers
 who are at a high risk of churning.
 By predicting customer churn, the company can proactively design retention strategies to
 keep these customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial loss.

 Tools Required: 
1. Python (with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
2.  Jupyter Notebook
